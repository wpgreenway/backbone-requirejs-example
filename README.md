# Backbone / RequireJS Example

This is an *incredibly* simple project that demonstrates how to take a project utilizing Backbone.js that is organized with require.js and optimize it with a basic grunt task.

To see it in action:

* Clone this repository
* Run "grunt"
	* The default task is "requirejs" which will minify/compress the application into a single script
* Run a python server by executing: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
* Navigate to localhost:8000 in your favorite browser
